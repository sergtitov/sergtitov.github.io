                        <h2>Custom-tailored</h2>

                        <p>I employ various teaching methods in my work. All the activities that I bring to my classes are custom-tailored for the needs of the student. Before we start, we discuss the goals of the student and develop a plan of study. I apply different teaching approaches and strategies to students of different age groups: it is more game-based with children, filled with creative tasks for teenagers, and more detailed with adults. But for all my students the content of study is directly linked to their personal lives, their work experience, their goals.</p>

                        <h2>Balanced</h2>

                        <p>I am interested in the story behind each student, and use it as a pathway to my lessons. I try to keep them balanced: to challenge, but not to overwhelm. I enjoy teaching both on 1-on-1 basis as well as in small groups. Getting to know my students as learners and people is a very rewarding experience. I particularly enjoy the “light bulb moments” and view them as stepping stones to success.</p>

                        <h2>Interesting</h2>

                        <p>In the most general way, my work is a combination of grammar and usage training, creative writing, reading, listening and working with video materials that keep my students interested. Each lesson and homework assignment are developed separately for each person or group I work with. I encourage my students to apply what they have learned in their everyday life, in international travel and communications.</p>
